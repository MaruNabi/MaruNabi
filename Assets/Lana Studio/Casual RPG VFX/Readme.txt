This asset uses the Built-in Render shader. The built-in render pipeline does not require any updates.

If you want to use this asset in a URP, be sure to apply an update to the URP. Go to the Casual RPG VFX/Upgrade for URP folder and run "Upgrade for URP".

In the URP, to make the demo scenes look like the demo video, you need to use Gamma Space. To do this, go to Edit/Project Setting, tab Player/Other Settings, select in Color Space - Gamma.

If you want to return to Built-in Render, re-import the asset from the Unity Asset Store.
